# Fundamentals of Computing - Learn through simulation
The study of Computer Science requires the comprehension of mathematical concepts, both discrete and logical, that are fundamental to understanding how computers operate and how to use them effectively and efficiently.

This project is concerned with the design and implementation of an instructional simulation tool that provides pedagogical support for the Fundamentals of Computing module material. The functionality allows students to delve into regular languages and automata, experimenting with writing regular expressions, designing automata and, observing in real time their behaviour and outcome.
