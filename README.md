# Fundamentals of Computing
## Learn through simulation
The study of Computer Science requires the comprehension of mathematical concepts, both discrete and logical, that are fundamental to understanding how computers operate and how to use them effectively and efficiently. Instructional simulations are a pedagogic support with the potential of engaging students into deep learning and empowering their understanding of these concepts as opposed to surface learning that requires only memorization.
